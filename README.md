# Global Economic Development Index 2023
Project Overview
This project analyzes global performance indicators, providing insights into various factors such as governance, human development, economic performance, and environmental sustainability across countries and regions. By using SQL for data preparation and Power BI for interactive visualizations, the project answers crucial questions on country rankings, regional trends, and the interrelationships between different performance indicators.
# Key Questions:
Global Overview:
1. Which countries rank highest and lowest in AverageScore?
2. How do regions perform on average in Overall Score and its sub-indicators?
3. What are the regional distributions of countries by performance?
   
Social & Governance:
1. How do countries perform in SafetySecurity, PersonalFreedom, and Governance?
2. Which regions are the safest, most free, or best governed?
3. How does governance impact personal freedom and safety?

Human Development: 
1. What are the global trends in LivingConditions, Health, and Education?
2. Which regions excel in human development, and where is improvement needed?
3. How do human development indicators correlate with overall scores?

Economic Performance: 
1. Which countries lead in EconomicQuality, MarketAccessInfrastructure, and EnterpriseConditions?
2. Are there significant regional differences in economic performance?
3. How does economic quality correlate with governance and market access?

Investment & Environment: 
1. What are the trends in InvestmentEnvironment and NaturalEnvironment?
2. Which regions have the best investment environments, and how does this relate to economic performance?
3. Which countries and regions are most environmentally sustainable?

# Tools Used:
__SQL:__ For data extraction, preparation, and cleaning.

__Power BI:__ For data visualization and creating the interactive dashboard.

# SQL:
The SQL queries used in this project include:

__Data Preparation and Cleaning:__
* Data extraction from the source database.
* Handling missing data and duplicates.
* Creating calculated columns like Overall_Score, Economic_Performance, etc.
* Joining data tables to consolidate indicators.

__Sample SQL Queries:__

`SELECT Region, Country, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Region ORDER BY AveragScore DESC) AS RegionalRank
FROM countries_development;`

`sql
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
UPDATE countries_development 
SET Country = TRIM(REPLACE(Country, 'Ã‚', ''));`

`UPDATE countries_development 
SET Country = REGEXP_REPLACE(Country, '^[[:space:]]+', '') -- Removes leading spaces 
WHERE Country REGEXP '^[[:space:]]+';`

__Calculations:__

Average Score Calculation: Calculation of the average scores of countries across different indicators like HDI, SafetySecurity, etc.

Performance Categorization: Identifying top and bottom countries based on overall performance scores.
